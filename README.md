# BandPass_FIR_Filter
Part of the Microprocessor Theory Course [EE2016] which took place in Jan-April 2020.
This project consists of an Assembly Language coded AVR Atmega8 Microcontroller simulated in Atmel Studio 7.0 that functions as a Band Pass Filter.
It takes the filter coefficients and the sampled input signal, computes the Discrete Time Convolution and returns the filtered output signal. Generation and Sampling of the signal was done using MATLAB.
